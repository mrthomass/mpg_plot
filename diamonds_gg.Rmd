Create an Rmarkdown file that shows the ggplot coding needed to create a scatterplot for x = carat and y = price from the diamonds data table. 

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.2) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Diamonds Carat vs. Price") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(family = "Times"),
        title = element_text(family = "Times"),
        axis.text = element_text(family = "Times"))
```
